# Liebow_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Project	Summary:
My program is a virus, it has a keylogger in it that records everything you type and stores potential passwords in a struct. also because its a virus after a period of time spent collecting data the virus will try and break your computer by eating away at its ram through random processes. like a music video being opened and played continuosly as well as very large random numbers being generated and multiplied. over all this program is just meant to get as much data as it can from a computer and then destroy it.

How	to	Run:
this virus is not weaponized, it will ask you to run the virus to make grading easier, but overall i would not run this program. if you want to use it to prank a friend id reccomend removing the restraints on the program by adding comments and deleting comments where it is outlined in the program. After that just email them the whole thing and say it was something cool you made.

Dependencies:
it doesnt depend on but works better with rickroll.avi in the repository
